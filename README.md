# kepler_ABC


This is a jupyter notebook implementing Approximate Bayesian Computation with importance sampling (Beaumont 2009) and applying it to the computation of exoplanet occurrence rates from Kepler data. It is still a work in progress.

It is built on top of a modified version of a jupyter notebook published in Dan Foreman-Mackey's blog post "An experiment in open science", at http://dan.iel.fm/posts/exopop/
